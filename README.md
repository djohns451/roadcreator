A free road creation tool for unity. It's currently in beta so it's pretty stable but still containes some bugs

## Features:
### Road Creation:
- Place, move and delete points to create a series of curves
- Generate roads with different width, texture and much more.
- Support for shoulders
- Options are changed per-segment which allows for more control like the road having a extra lane before a intersection
- Curve smoothing to avoid sharp turns between curves
- Option to make a prefab line follow it for easy bridge creation etc
- Terrain deformation to make the terrain adjust to the road

### Prefab Line Tool:
- Includes a prefab line tool to place prefabs along a series of curves (can also curve the mesh to get a smoother curve)
- Options to curve the mesh and also to fill in the gap between them to get a smootly curved and connected line of prefabs


### Intersections Etc:
- Generate intersections with 1 - 4 connections (square, triangle and diamond intersections)
- Modify variables such as connection height and width per connection
- Generate customizable roundabouts
- Includes a bunch of roads and road related assets like turn markings and road signs
- Create timed traffic lights
